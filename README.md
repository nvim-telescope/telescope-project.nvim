## Setup

You can setup the extension by adding the following to your config:

```lua
require'telescope'.load_extension('project')
```

## Available functions:

### Project

The projects picker.

```lua
require'telescope'.extensions.project.project{}
```

## Example config: 

```lua
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap(
	'n',
	'<C-p>',
	":lua require'telescope'.extensions.project.project{}<CR>",
	{noremap = true, silent = true}
)
```

## Default mappings (normal mode):

d: delete currently selected project  
r: rename currently selected project  
c: create a project (defaults to your git root if used inside a git project, 
otherwise it will use your current working directory)  
s: search inside files within your project  
b: browse inside files within your project  
w: change to the selected project's directory without opening it  
r: find a recently opened file within your project  
f: find a file within your project (this works the same as \<CR\>)

## Available options:

Options can be added when requiring telescope project, as shown below:  
```lua require'telescope'.extensions.project.project{ display_type = 'full' }```

display_type:  

- 'full' (Show the title and the path of the project)  
-	'minimal' (Default. Show the title of the project only)
